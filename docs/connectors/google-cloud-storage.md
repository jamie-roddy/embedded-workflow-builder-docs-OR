Manage files in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Storage bucket

## Connections

### Google Cloud Storage Private Key

Authenticate requests to Google Cloud Storage using a Private Key

To authenticate with Google Cloud Storage, a service account with a private key is required.

For more information on creating service accounts, refer to [Google Cloud's authentication documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).

#### Prerequisites

- Access to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project
- Permissions to create service accounts and assign roles

#### Setup Steps

To create a service account and generate a private key:

1. Navigate to the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page in the Google Cloud Console
2. Select a project or create a new one
3. Click **Create Service Account**
4. Enter a service account name and description, then click **Create and Continue**
5. Assign the appropriate role:
   - For full access to Cloud Storage: Select **Cloud Storage Admin**
   - For specific permissions: Select a resource-specific role based on requirements
6. Click **Continue**, then **Done**
7. In the service accounts list, click on the newly created service account
8. Navigate to the **Keys** tab
9. Click **Add Key** and select **Create new key**
10. Select **JSON** as the key type and click **Create**
11. A JSON file will be downloaded containing the service account credentials

#### Configure the Connection

The downloaded JSON file contains several fields including **type**, **project_id**, **private_key**, **client_email**, and others.

Enter the following values from the JSON file into the connection configuration:

- Extract the required fields from the JSON file
- Enter the **Project ID** (GCP Project ID)
- Enter the service account credentials from the JSON file

:::info Service Account Permissions
Ensure the service account has the appropriate permissions to access the Cloud Storage resources needed for the integration. Resource-specific permissions can be used for more granular access control.
