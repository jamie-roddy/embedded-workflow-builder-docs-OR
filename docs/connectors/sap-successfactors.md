## Connections

### API Key Authentication

API Key Authentication for SAP SuccessFactors Connection

#### Generate X.509 Certificate

First, generate an X.509 certificate and private key pair using OpenSSL:

```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048

# Generate certificate signing request
openssl req -new -key private.pem -out cert.csr

# Generate self-signed certificate (valid for 365 days)
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in cert.csr -signkey private.pem -out public.pem
```

Save both `private.pem` (private key) and `public.pem` (certificate) files for later use.

#### Register OAuth2 Client Application

1. Log into your SAP SuccessFactors instance as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Admin Center** > **API Center** > **OAuth Configuration for OData**
   - Alternatively, search for `Manage OAuth2 Client Applications` in Action Search
3. Select **Register Client Application**
4. Configure the OAuth2 client application:
   - **Application Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your application
   - **Application URL**: Enter your application URL
   - **X.509 Certificate**: Upload or paste the contents of your `public.pem` certificate file
5. Click **Register** to create the application
6. Copy the **API Key** (also called Client ID) that is generated - you'll need this for authentication
7. From the integration connection fill in the required fields:
   - **Company ID**: Your SAP SuccessFactors company identifier
   - **User**: Your SAP SuccessFactors user ID (e.g., `sfadmin`)
   - **API Key**: The OAuth2 API Key from your registered client application
   - **Issuer**: Issuer information of the SAML assertion (e.g., `www.successfactors.com`)
   - **Certificate Private Key**: Your private certificate key for OAuth2 authentication (PEM format, including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` headers)
   - **Certificate**: Your public certificate for OAuth2 authentication (PEM format, including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` headers)
   - **Audiences**: Audiences of the SAML assertion (e.g., `www.successfactors.com`)
   - **API Server** (optional): Your SAP SuccessFactors API server (defaults to sandbox environment if not specified)
   - **Protocol**: The protocol to use for API connections
